					<Text>The Track Junction is the key to enabling intelligent distribution of resources across your entire fortress. Junctions link to each other to form a transport grid that freight carts can navigate to freight station destinations. With these it is possible to connect every production center, near and far, with a supply of resources from anywhere in the fortress.</Text>

				<Text>The track junction&apos;s color will change to reflect the number of registered connections. Red indicates no connections have been registered, orange indicates 1, yellow 2, green 3, and blue indicates all 4 routes are connected.
					
				It is perfectly valid for a junction path to lead back to itself. A connection can lead to a station, turn the cart around with a buffer, and return to the original junction and register as a valid connection. Closed loops that do not end at a junction however are forbidden.
				
				Currently, connections are only recognized as broken when a junction, station, or depot is removed. If a track connected to a junction is modified or removed the junction will need to be replaced or reset to refresh the connections. If a connection is broken without refreshing the junction carts will continue to attempt to travel the broken route!  Press Q on a junction to reset the track connections. This is advisable after any track layout change.</Text>
