					<Text>Freight Cart Depots add Freight Carts into your freight network. Place a Storage Hopper adjacent to the Depot with appropriate permissions, ensure the Depot is connected to the track system linking to Freight Cart Stations, and set cart assignments for any desired stations that the carts should service and the depot will send carts on their way. Each Depot is limited to a single Freight Cart placement per 15 secondes.  
					
					Freight Carts will return to the depot if there is no longer work for them among the accessible stations.  Ensure that carts have a route back to the depot.  The depot requires at least one Storage Hopper with appropriate permissions set to accept the incoming cart.  You may use separate depots for launching and returning carts.
